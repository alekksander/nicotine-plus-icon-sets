# What is it?

The purpose of this repository is to collect and host alternative icon sets for Nicotine+, an open source Soulseek network client (https://github.com/Nicotine-Plus/nicotine-plus/).


# Who is it for?
It is for users who don't want to make, or look up and extract specific icons from existing themes, but want to skim and adjust N+ solely.


# Note
For now it contains only one set â€” suitable for Numix theme (https://github.com/numixproject/), but in future i will try to cover more popular themes. Contributions are highly welcome.
